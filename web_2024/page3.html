<p> The Titanic-bound submersible that went missing on Sunday with five people on board suffered a catastrophic implosion, killing everyone on board. The submersible was descending to explore the wreckage of the luxury liner, located 900 miles east of Cape Cod and about 13,000 feet below sea level. Research and rescue teams found Thursday morning outer parts of the Titan near the site of the Titanic wreckage. OceanGate, the company that led the mission, said the men on board are dead. This is a very sad time for the entire explorer community, and for each of the family members of those lost at sea. The debris found on the ocean floor about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic was consistent with catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber in the submersible. </p>
